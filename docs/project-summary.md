# Project Summary

## Introduction
This project demonstrates how to set up an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) and connect it to three different EC2 instances running different operating systems: Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux, and Amazon Linux 2. The primary goal is to ensure secure and efficient management of AWS resources and to monitor these instances for errors or misconfigurations.

## Objectives
- Create an Amazon EFS
- Launch EC2 instances with different operating systems
- Connect each EC2 instance to the EFS
- Ensure secure and efficient resource management

## Implementation
1. **Amazon EFS Creation**: An EFS was created in the selected VPC with default settings.
2. **EC2 Instances**: Three EC2 instances were launched with the following operating systems:
   - Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS
   - Red Hat Enterprise Linux
   - Amazon Linux 2
3. **Mounting EFS**: Each EC2 instance was configured to mount the EFS to a directory using the NFS protocol.

## Results
- **Ubuntu Instance**: Successfully mounted the EFS and verified connectivity.
- **Red Hat Linux Instance**: Successfully mounted the EFS and verified connectivity.
- **Amazon Linux 2 Instance**: Successfully mounted the EFS and verified connectivity.

## Conclusion
The project showcases the ability to set up and manage AWS resources effectively, ensuring secure and efficient operations across different operating systems.
